# 🧠 Neuro-Symbolic AI for Commonsense Reasoning

This project explores a hybrid AI approach that integrates symbolic reasoning with neural networks to solve commonsense reasoning tasks. It combines knowledge from **ConceptNet** with **Transformer-based models (BERT)** for question answering.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Combine symbolic reasoning (via ConceptNet) with neural models (BERT) for enhanced commonsense understanding.
- Evaluate the hybrid system on a subset of the **CommonsenseQA** dataset.
- Demonstrate improved interpretability and performance through neuro-symbolic fusion.
